Conservative management including 8 weeks of physical therapy (2x/week) and NSAIDs (naproxen 500mg BID) has failed to provide adequate relief. Patient reports progressive numbness in left foot over the past 3 weeks, consistent with L5-S1 nerve root involvement. No prior lumbar imaging on record. MRI of the lumbar spine without contrast is medically necessary per LCD L34220 to evaluate for disc herniation or spinal stenosis and guide further treatment planning.",
