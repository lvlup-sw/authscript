**AuthScript Context and Resources** 

### **AuthScript pitch…**

### *Every week, doctors spend hours fighting insurance paperwork instead of treating patients. We're building the AI that fixes that.*

### *Here's the problem: A patient needs medication. The doctor knows it's medically necessary. But before the patient can get it, someone has to spend 30 minutes digging through clinical notes, filling out insurance forms, and hoping it doesn't get denied. Multiply that by 40 requests per week, and you've got doctors drowning in paperwork.*

### *Our AI agent solves this in three steps:*

### *First, it reads the patient's medical record (in the EHR) \- notes, labs, imaging, everything \- and understands what's clinically relevant.*

### *Second, it knows exactly what each insurance company wants to see. Blue Cross needs different justifications than UnitedHealthcare. Our AI speaks their language.*

### *Third, it builds the entire prior authorization form automatically. Clinical justifications, diagnosis codes, treatment history \- all filled out in under three minutes. The doctor just reviews and clicks submit.*

### *The result? What took 30 minutes now takes 5\. Doctors get 10 hours back every week. Patients get their medications faster. And approval rates go up because the AI knows exactly what makes insurers say yes.*

### *We're not just streamlining paperwork. We're giving doctors their time back \- so they can focus on what they actually went to medical school for: taking care of people.*

###   **What is Prior Authorization?**

Prior authorization is a health insurance requirement where providers must obtain advance approval from the insurance company before delivering certain medical services, procedures, or medications to ensure they will be covered and paid for.

It's a cost-control process intended to reduce waste and limit unnecessary services [AJMC](https://www.ajmc.com/view/prior-authorizations-and-the-adverse-impact-on-continuity-of-care), though it now applies to many routine treatments beyond just expensive interventions. Prior authorization forms are inconsistent in the information required depending on the procedure requested, the insurance company and insurance companies frequently change the forms. Example prior auth forms are [**HERE**](?tab=t.q90n0a11cist).

### **Who prepares prior authorization requests?**

Physicians complete an average of 39 prior authorization requests per week, requiring 13 hours of staff time [Surescripts](https://surescripts.com/prior-authorization-challenges-data). The responsibility varies by practice size and resources.

**In smaller practices:** Physicians often handle much of the PA work themselves, including form completion, documentation gathering, and follow-up.

**In larger practices:** Approximately 40% of physicians have dedicated staff members who work exclusively on prior authorization tasks [American Medical Association](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/prior-authorization/pains-prior-authorization-create-pressure-reform)[American College of Physicians](https://www.acponline.org/advocacy/state-health-policy/toolkit-addressing-the-administrative-burden-of-prior-authorization). Nurses, practice managers, and billing coordinators typically handle the administrative workflows [Promantra](https://promantra.us/blog/prior-authorization-burden/).

**Physicians always handle:**

* Clinical documentation and medical necessity justification  
* Signing PA request forms  
* Peer-to-peer reviews with insurance medical directors

**Support staff handle:**

* Form completion and data entry  
* Submission and tracking  
* Follow-up communications with payers

### **What systems are involved?**

**1\. Electronic Health Records (EHR):** EHR systems integrate with electronic prior authorization tools, allowing staff to be guided through entering required clinical details and submitting attachments directly from the patient record [Surescripts](https://surescripts.com/what-we-do/electronic-prior-authorization).

**2\. Practice Management (PM) Systems:** Authorization verification tools integrate with PM systems to instantly analyze orders and determine if authorization is required [Waystar](https://www.waystar.com/our-platform/financial-clearance/authorizations/).

**3\. Payer Portals:** 39% of prior authorizations are done through payer portals or interactive voice response systems, requiring separate logins for each health plan [TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/revcyclemanagement/answer/From-AI-to-Regulation-Making-Progress-with-the-Prior-Authorization-Process).
