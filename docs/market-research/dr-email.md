Hi Dr. Negusse,

Thanks again for making the time to chat with us. Following up on our texts, I wanted to get this on the calendar for a time that works after your 2 PM block.

**To get you in the right mindset for our questions:** As mentioned, my team at UW is researching how to automate the "insurance fights" regarding Prior Authorizations. We know **Biologics** are a specific pain point in GI, so we want to focus our 15 minutes there.

We’d love to learn:

1. **The Workflow:** How does your office currently handle the back-and-forth for biologic approvals? (e.g., Is it mostly phone calls? Portals?)
2. **The Friction:** Where do you see the most wasted time? (e.g., Waiting on hold? Re-submitting lost faxes? Peer-to-peer reviews?)
3. **The Wishlist:** If you could automate one part of this process, what would it be?

If this time no longer works, please feel free to propose a new one directly on this invite.

Talk soon,

Liam
