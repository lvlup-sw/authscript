# Dr. Negusse Interview Questions

**Focus:** Prior Authorization friction for Biologics in GI
**Duration:** 15 minutes

---

## 1. The Workflow (5 min)

**Primary:** "Walk me through what happens from the moment you decide a patient needs a biologic to when they actually get it."

**Follow-ups:**
- "Who touches this process? MA? Nurse? Dedicated PA staff?"
- "Do payers give you different experiences? (e.g., Is UHC worse than Premera?)"

---

## 2. The Friction Points (5 min)

**Primary:** "Where do things get stuck most often?"

**Probes:**
- "How often do you have to do peer-to-peer calls? How long are you on hold?"
- "Do you ever have to re-submit because something got 'lost'?"
- "What clinical documentation do they always ask for that takes time to gather?"

**Key metric:** "What percentage of your biologic PAs get approved on first submission vs. requiring appeal?"

---

## 3. The Wishlist (5 min)

- "If we could auto-fill the PA form with evidence from the chart, would that save meaningful time—or is the real pain elsewhere?"
- "Would you trust an AI to draft the clinical justification, or would you need to review every word?"
- "What would make you say 'I need this tool yesterday'?"

---

## Bonus (if time)

- "Are there specific biologics that are worse than others?" (Humira vs. Stelara vs. newer agents)
- "Do you use any EHR shortcuts or templates today?"

---

## Listen For

- Is the pain **form-filling** (what we're building) or **payer bureaucracy** (peer-to-peer, arbitrary denials)?
- What clinical evidence do they repeatedly need to gather?
- Any workflow hacks they've already developed
