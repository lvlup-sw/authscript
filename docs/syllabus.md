**Assignments**  
All assignments (except for pitch decks) should be emailed to Alex Ray ([alex@psl.com](mailto:alex@psl.com))

**COURSE OBJECTIVES**  
   
The course objectives are twofold: (1) to develop an awareness and understanding of the range, scope, and complexity of issues involved in starting a technology business; and (2) to gain insight into how entrepreneurs conceive, adapt, and execute strategies to create new, successful businesses.

**COURSE OVERVIEW**  
   
This course is about entrepreneurship and specifically about starting, growing, managing, leading, and ultimately exiting a new venture. Of all the courses you take at the University of Washington, this one will likely be the most hands-on. Sixty percent of your grade will be based on pitches, product demos, and a business plan that you develop with your team.  
   
The course sessions will follow the natural order of starting a new business: choosing your idea and your team, validating that idea with customers, honing your initial pitch, dealing with the legal issues of starting a business, building a great product, deciding among financing strategies, developing a go-to-market and operating plan, and exiting successfully. We will spend part of nearly every three-hour block giving you feedback on your actual pitches, your product, and your business generally. To ensure that this course is practical, we will invite numerous guests who are currently working in the venture and entrepreneurial ecosystem: founders, CEOs, venture capitalists, lawyers, journalists, and others involved in the startup and broader technology community.

**Due next week:** Prepare as a team \- *and email to Alex prior to class* \- a one-to-two page investment memo in which you choose another team you would invest in, detail why (team, opportunity, business model, etc.), and on what terms. You are playing the role of venture capitalist. You will be considering whether to make a $1M investment in a Series Seed round in your classmates’ company. The memo should contain the following: (1) one sentence about whether or not you are recommending an investment (if you want, you can use our 10-point scoring system to show how strongly you feel about the investment decision), (2) why you would (or would not) make an investment, covering items such as the (a) team, (b) product, (c) market size, (d) business model, and (e) timing, but feel free to focus primarily on the areas most relevant to your investment decision or employ a framework like the one we discussed the first day of class, (3) the terms of your $1 million investment (if you are recommending not to invest, you can still cover the terms by saying if your partners approve it notwithstanding your negative recommendation, you would recommend investing on the following terms), covering (a) pre-money valuation (e.g., $1M on a $3M pre-money valuation would give the investors 25% of the company post-money, and you might say what your pre-money starting point for negotiation is and what your walk-away pre-money valuation might be), (b) the control provisions (e.g., you can say you just want the standard control provisions or specify one or two that are especially important to you and, if so, why), and (c) the board composition (e.g., we think it should be one founder/CEO, one investor, and one independent, and how important board control is to you if the founders push back and say the common/founders need to control the board).

**Class \#10: Wednesday, March 11, 2026**  
**Company Pitch Day**  
**4:30 pm, Pioneer Square Labs, 240 2nd Ave S Ste 300**

**Assignment:**  Your team will have eight minutes to present your business to a panel of top venture capital and angel investors and then take five minutes of Q\&A. In advance, please *send via email to Alex, Greg and Ed prior to class* your complete pitch deck, a two-to-three-page executive summary, your financial plan, and some illustrations of your demo (a few slides that will remind us of what you showed). The financial plan can use the templates from the financial modeling presentation. We would like to see more detailed financial projections month-over-month for the first 12 months and then higher-level year-over-year projections for three years (not more). We care more about the reasonableness of the assumptions in the financial model than about the numbers, so just be clear to show what the driving assumptions are. If one person is driving the model, make sure to sanity-check it with your teammates.
